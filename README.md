                <p>Many people struggle to comprehend how ordinances and resolutions are proposed, debated, and implemented. This creates confusion about the roles of government officials and the impact of legislative decisions on their community.</p>

                <img src="icon2.png" alt="Icon 2" width="40">
                <p>When information about legislative processes is unclear or inaccessible, citizens often feel excluded and unmotivated to engage. This lack of involvement can result in decisions being made without sufficient public input or awareness, further weakening democratic participation.</p>

                <p>Without detailed and consolidated information about the contributions and stances of legislators, voters find it difficult to assess their representativesâ€™ performance and accountability. This undermines their ability to make informed choices during elections.</p>
